# Project19084
A small project demonstrating the work of an art gallery.
It works with three database tables: Artists, Artwork and Exhibitions.
Artists table contains ids and names of all the artists "working" for the art gallery, Exhibitions table consists of names of exhibitions, their location, start date and end date. Finally, Artwork table contains the names of the paintings, era they were painted in, their price and foreign keys on artists and exhibitions.
The project uses a number of methods to successfully process relevant data from the tables, such as: add, update, delete, search by a certain criteria...
The three-layer architecture is implemented, with various design patterns (such as Dao or MVC). 
A simple front-end design is also implemented: one using javafx, one using command line interface.
